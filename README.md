## Video Walkthrough

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/cb3f3c9a8399464abab85d040b179355?sid=57e6e003-95c6-40f2-a4df-72f2df19e674" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Book App
-can drag the page like an actual book
-can change the color of the pages

IMessage
- can send audio messages
- can edit messages

X
-can add pictures in comments
-can go on dark mode 

I would like to build a To-do list app accompanied with a pomdoro timer that when a task is crossed off it sends a "celebration across the screen." Another feature I would to add is putting a time-sensitive reminder that alerts the user on a specific to-do.

## Notes

I had trouble with getting the button to connect to ViewController, however everything else went smoothly.
